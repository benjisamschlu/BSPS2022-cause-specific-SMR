* Conceptual framework

   * 3 dimensions to study environmental health inequalities
   
      * Socioeconomic deprivation
      
      * Environmental exposure
      
      * Health outcomes
      
Pairwise integration of these dimensions gives rise to three concepts

   * Health inequalities
   
   * Environmental inequalities
   
   * Environmental health
  
Integration of all three: environmental health inequalities

# Data

### Cause-specific mortality rates 

* Aggregate-level data from Belgian national civil register 

* Cause of death certificates 

* 13 broad causes of death (based on ICD10 codes)

`r fontawesome::fa("arrow-right")` Cause-specific death counts and exposures by 5 year age group, sex and municipality over 2006-2016

### Covariates

* Belgian index of multiple deprivation 2011 (Martina's paper)

* Environmental exposures (in development)

# Methodology

.pull-left[
### Standardized Mortality Ratios

Municipality $i$, gender $s$ and CoD $a$,

$SMR^{i} = \frac{obs.~deaths^{{i}}}{exp.~deaths^{{i}}}$

$exp.~deaths^{i} = \sum{}_nm_x^{Nat} \cdot {}_nE_x^{i}$

.pull-right[
### BYM2 Poisson model

Municipality $i$, gender $s$ and CoD $a$,

$obs.~deaths^{i} \sim Poi(\theta^{i} \cdot exp.~deaths^{i})$

$log(\theta_i) = \mu + x_i\beta + \phi_i + u_i$

$\phi_i ~ from ~ ICAR ~ model$

$u_i \sim N(0, \sigma_u^2)$
